Generated by the script:
•	data/data_tidy.txt: output of the project generated by run_analysis.R; contains a header and 180 rows (30 subjects x 6 activities)
Variables Description
Result dataset: data_tidy.txt

•	Subject: subject ID, comes from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt files
•	Activity: activity as a factor, comes from y_train.txt and y_test.txt files
•	All mean measurements in the form ID-(mean|std)[-X|Y|Z], e.g fBodyAcc-mean-X, fBodyBodyGyroMag-std. There are 66 measurements in the tidy.txt dataset. The original measurements come from X_train.txt and X_test.txt.
Transformations
The following steps are performed by run_analysis.R to generate tidy.txt:
•	install necessary packages: DataTable and Reshape2
•	and load the datasets on the hard drive

•	Extract the Mean and SD of the "test" data
•	Give comprehensive names to variables
•	Bind the "test" datasets, and call it data_test

• Extract the Mean and SD of the "train" data
•	Give comprehensive names to variables
•	Bind the "train" datasets, and call it data_train

•	Bind the "test" and "train" data

•	Use the dcast function to apply mean to the full table, and create the data_tidy.txt file
