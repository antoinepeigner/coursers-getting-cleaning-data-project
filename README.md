# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is the repository for my project "getting and cleaning data".
The purpose is to read, clean and re-order 6 datasets into 1 comprehensive one.
The steps and functions are described in the CodeBook.md document in this same repository.
The final output file is called data_tidy.txt and is also stored on this same Github repository.
The script creating the output file is in the same repository and is called "run_analysis.R".
